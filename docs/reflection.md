    When designing these two very different websites I learned a whole lot about both WordPress and GitHub/Markdown. On one hand with GitHub, it was a similar concept to HTML web design, with a very different format. As for Word Press, it was a completely new process for me and it took me a few hours of researching and testing to begin growing more comfortable with the platform. GitHub and WordPress have very contrasting approaches to web development. GitHub requires knowledge of basic coding and the way that files work together. WordPress was more its own thing and required you to figure out how the program itself works with files and itself. GitHub took a lot more trial and error and I felt extremely limited in what I could do with it. I know that it has a higher reward if I were to learn about it more, however at my current skill level I felt as if I was working within the constraints of my knowledge and what basic coding that I knew. As for WordPress, I felt that I could express what I wanted to a bit more, although I still donâ€™t know everything there is to about the program, I still felt less caged in what I could create and therefore I experimented with slideshows, picture backgrounds, and widgets. I preferred WordPress drastically in this assignment, however I believe as I become more proficient with GitHub, they will become more equal in my eyes.
